We have been left behind by some other groups and are trying to pik up the pace. We figured out how to link the movement of a player to a joystick by simply adding a movement input with the pawn movement comp. I completed a health pack, that starts a timer
that is called after a function, and spawns a new health pack in 20 seconds. I also made spikes that spawn after a short period, then despawn, then repeat. to deal damage to those not paying attention. I have also made a moving saw blade, that uses a timeline to
move back and forth across both the x and y axis. We also have set up a bunch of nessisary functions in the game mode, like setting up the garage, loading screen, and to tell players when to spawn their controls. We are also working on level design and underglow using construction script,
if a mech is a certain ID in an array held in the gamemode, then we set different materials and colors. Overall I think with a few more assest we can really start making this game actually work, till then I am still tesring different mechanics that we could potentially add to our game.
