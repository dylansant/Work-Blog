This week we redesigned our game completely. Our sword on our character now gets the location of the mouse in the 3d world and faces it perfectly, using the get look at rotation node. We also changes many values on our enemies and player, such as
damage and health to help the game feel more balanced. I tested with lighting and how changing certain values such as light effectivness can make our game look better or worse. I also changed how our agro-range works, by instead of using two factors
to detirmine if the enemy should follow the player, it uses one. What I did was took the enemies location and subtracted it from the players to find a distance between in the value of a float (vector to float). Using a variable called agro
range that can be set by the designers,if the distanct between the player and enemy is less than the agro range then the enemy will follow. But now after the most recent change, when the player leaves that range it will continue to follow no matter what.
In short terms what this change was is when the player enters the range of an enemy the enemy will follow the player til they either die and despawn to follow with our new game direction. Additionally fixed some bugs with how the player moves, 
and the rotations of the 2d assests as they are different than the usual 3d in Unreal engine. Overall a pretty productive week, fixing many issue with the game and sending our game in a new direction.
