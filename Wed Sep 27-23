These last few weeks I spent most my time trying to make a functioning joystick. While I was ultimately unsuccessful, I have been redirected to make a touch interface for our game. Getting results under a tapped location and storing that information
in a structure of variables. I have managed to make 3 functions connected to the InputTouch event that are called when something is touched/pressed, released, and when the touch is moved (1 function for each event). The only function near completion
starts by making an aray, getting a hit result under finger for objects, then it gets a bunch of results and puts them into the structure. Then, in implements my Blueprint Interface (Touchable), if it is impletmented then it adds the information to the
active touches Map. Overall I feel like we are on the right track, and am starting to understand more and more about unreal. Although things are way more complex than what I thought a few weeks ago...
