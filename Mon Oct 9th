We had our first game jam! The game jam has been so fun and I feel like we made it very far. We created a retro, tycoon like game to celebrate the 50th anniversary. I created widget to display and update money and year values, which I had little problem with.
Most importantly, I think the biggest takeaway from this is teaching everyone how to use Github. I learned how to use timers, and make parent classes colaborate with child classes to make simular actors with basic functions,
and give them different functions. I loved this game jam, it was nice working with a new team and learning something outside of our main game. We also learned that organizing is really important in projects, for finding assests, and finding blueprints you need to change.
Overall I think that this game jam was very useful, it taught usall how to use github and how to learn things quickly and use documentation!!
