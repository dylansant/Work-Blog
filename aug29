I continued to practice using the blueprint feature in Unreal Engine 5, finishing the door opening and closing function. The door was not operating correctly,so I had to look through each of the variables to see if the values were correct.
Turns out that the time to close/open variables had not been set, and changing those variable made my door apen correctly. The next blueprint mini-project I did was making a health and stamina system, and make it appear in the form of a UI.
The health bar was not working properly, and my only mistake in the tutorial is forgetting to compile my UI progress bar. After compiling everything was working properly. Overall I think I am heading in the right direction in terms of learning UE5,
and we should have a playable game by October 1st. Which will not look good by no means, but we will get a headstart into making our incredible game. On the design side of things, I can up with multiple ideas for abilities, and how the stats should
work within the game. We still have not figured out what the game exactly will be as of yet, but it is a daily conversation that is being had as everyone on our team learns the things to put our "robot game" into life.
