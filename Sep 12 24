This week was pretty busy and I completed a lot. The first main thing I did was make a checkpoint for our character, this was really simple. When the character overlaps the checkpoint, we set a variable in the player that is called "Active
Checkpoint" which is just a object referance to whichever checkpoint was interacted with most recently. From this variable we can access a respawn point for the character, where after the player dies will be teleported. Resetting the character
takes a little time, so I added a loading screen in between death and reset to make the flow a little nicer. Later I will add more functionality to the loading screens, but for now they just cover the screen for a given duration. Another thing
that was added was loot. Whenever an enemy dies, they will spawn a new actor that, when overlaped adds an amount of currency to the play via variable. I started to develop bosses and enemies as well, making my own Behavior tree and making enemies
only move toward the player within a certain range. When in range I also made it so that a widget displays a boss healthbar across the top of the screen. There were so many minor errors that I used the output log to fix, and one issue we had is
our game not packaging which was an issue with permissions and restrictions on the computer. Another pretty simple solution that involved ajusting the permissions Unreal Engine had. Overall a pretty simple week, we've made progress faster than 
any other game we had worked on. Honestly we are pretty proud of ourselves, but we still have a lot of work to do.
