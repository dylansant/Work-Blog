We have completed a lot in our game over this large gap in between my work blogs. I am starting to regain passion for our game as we are really starting to make a fun game. We've added so much such as shooting, abilities, and mech customization.
But we still have quite a lot to do on every aspect of this project. What I did today is used materials and material parameters to set team colors, to tell your mech from the rest. As I made this we ran into some problems that we wouls have needed
to fix in the future so I am glad that I fixed them now. Niagara is one of the main things that I am excited to start adding to our project, but I lack total understanding of how it works and how to make cool effects without the help of an artist.
I plan on researching more about niagara to make our game begin to look visually appealing. On the code side of things, I feel like we have a solid base of our game up, but we need to start polishing and adding a win condision to our game.
Overall, I feel like we've had some issues with staying engaged these past few months, but I think we are about to start heading into the right direction as we all are starting to get more motivated about our game.
