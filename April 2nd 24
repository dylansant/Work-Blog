So we have switched games as we felt our original game has lost speed quickly, and we began to be passonate for another project. We began a tower defense game and already have so much down. I developed a shop widget that allows us to spawn in a tower that checks if we can afford the tower and spends currency on the tower. So we already have a currentcy system, a drag and drop system, 
a shooting system, and some main menu UI already up and functional. This game is making me excited as we are actually seeing progress in a rapid rate, and I feel like we will be able to finish before the deadline. We just need to get some levels made and some art in and we will be off to the races. As of now, im figuring out how to add a upgrade screen after we click on a tower to allow
the player to choose to upgrade or close the UI. I am also going to be animating UI and widgets soon as well.
