Finally finished my shooting range target game tutorial. This game includes a timer, targets, and a gun, and you must shoot all target before the time runs out! One of my favorite parts about this is the tutorial let me figure things out on my own.
For example, the target counter was not working. How it was supposed to start was at BeginPlay it should have gotten the number of the target actors currently in the scene. But, the tutorial had glossed over the part where I had to set my MaxScore
varible to the number of targets. It was pretty easily fixed once I figure it out and it displayed correctly (current score/ max score) and the box collision on the target worked properly. The next thing the I had to implemnt was a endscreen.
The endscreen used UE5's widgets to create a screen that said either "You Win!" or "You lose!" with a restart button. To make the player win, when they have hit all targets, a seperate custom event takes place after the game checks if the players
CurrentScore equals MaxScore. This event, titled WinGame adds the "You Win!" widget to the viewport. And the "You Lose!" endscreen occurs when the timer set equals 0. Last thing added was on Collision with bullet actor, the target simulates physics
and destroys. Overall, I would say this tutorial has helped me understand UE5 a lot better, and makes me feel confident that I am heading on the right track to have a completed game. My teams game (while the name is still to be detirmined)
has grown into many different ideas and is starting to sound like a full game. Me and others have made so many ideas of abilities, maps, and stats. I designed a dash ability, a ice map where the mechs could slide on, and helped come up
with a basic damage system to list a few. I love learning about UE5, and I can't wait to see the wounderful game that we have designed in action!
