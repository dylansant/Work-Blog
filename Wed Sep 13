I was sick for most of this week, but last week was a very accomplishing week. I explored a lot of Unreal Engine mechanics in the UE5 content examples prodject. I discovered how to effectivly use lighting, and merging animations to make the
character look clean in movement. There was a lot to explore, and there still is plenty of more, but I feel like this interactive project has helped me understand more UE5 content that it has to offer. I also experimented with things that will be in our game,
for example, I had figured out how to make a stationary camera and how to add joysticks for our characters on screen. The thing I am most worried about is how we will make our joysticks and UI work well. Im excited to use the things I have learned
from the content examples project to make our game look and feel good. Last week I had noticed that our stats and damage system is incredibly unbalanced, so for the rest of this week me and my team will be talking a bunch about how the combat 
section of the game will be played out and where we will move foward in terms of balancing.
