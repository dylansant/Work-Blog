Lask week the main I worked on is damage numbers and getting a bigger reaction when the player hits an enemy. With this we spawn an actor containing a widget that has a number bound to the damage. I used Algebra to come up with an equation for the size of the font based on the amount of damage we do
to the enemy. 2d=Font size where D equals the damage. So if we deal 20 damage the size of the font will be doubled. 2 can be any number and we may find another to be better in the future. I also made a equation for the color of the text which is D/M=RGB which is Damage divided by max damage to get
a decimal below 1 to fit into any of the RGB values. Using data analysis, I changed the health and damage of a few enemies so that the tutorial of the game isn't to hard for the player to get used to. Before the player could get basically one shot,
everything would die too quickly. We ran into an error with our "Nav Mesh Bounds Volume" which builds our navigation for our enemy AI, which we solved by removing some files and ajusting its location to rebuild our navigaion. With the equations I made
it allows for it to be expanable and easily changed at anytime so if we want to change anything all we have to do is change some numbers/variables such as font size, color, (By changing damage and the Font size multiplier) damage. In conclution I think
our game is heading in the right direction, as we are more organized and efficent.
